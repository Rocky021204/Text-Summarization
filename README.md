This project was developed as part of my Data Science Internship at Proxenix. The aim was to build a system capable of:

Generating concise and coherent summaries of lengthy text documents.
Performing sentiment analysis to classify the emotional tone of the content (positive, negative, neutral).
The project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with machine learning models to enable efficient understanding and interpretation of large volumes of textual data.

🔍 Features

🔹 Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
🔹 Extractive and Abstractive Summarization using NLP libraries and Transformer models.
🔹 Sentiment Analysis using pretrained models (e.g., Vader, TextBlob, or BERT).
🔹 Visualization of sentiment distribution.
🔹 Clean and modular code for easy adaptation.
